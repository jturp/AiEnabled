AiEnabled NPC Mod

AiEnabled is a total NPC inclusion mod that aims to spice up your gameplay by providing you with companions to aid you as well as enemies to hunt you. All NPCs use custom pathfinding logic to perform their assigned role. As ideas flow and time permits, I'll be adding more NPCs to keep things interesting!
